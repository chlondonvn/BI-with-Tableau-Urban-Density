## Project Description
For IronHack's DATA 08.20 cohort the following workbook was created, including the creation of different sheets, dashboards to organize them and a story.


## Questions & Process

"The Sustainable Development Goals are a call for action by all countries – poor, rich and middle-income – to promote prosperity while protecting the planet. They recognize that ending poverty must go hand-in-hand with strategies that build economic growth and address a range of social needs including education, health, social protection, and job opportunities, while tackling climate change and environmental protection."

Cities, already by the year 2050 are expected to be home for most of the World's population. Therefore Cities, their structure, infrastructure, organization, services and people are one of the world's most important problems to adress in order to achieve a sustainable future. 

How are the top cities with most Urban Built Infrastructure populated? How are these built spaces relating to the open space? How are these spaces related to the quantity of people living in it? 

For the understanding of how to achieve a healthy, sustainable urban lifestyle and in order to reach the United Nations Sustainable Development goals, we need to understand te current situation in the elements that play major roll in climate change: cities itselves. It is from these previous questions and frame of work that the visualizations were produced. 

## Workflow

The initial data frame was evaluated and called with head(), then an understanding of the shape() of the data frame was made.  The work organization started after a "sketch" of a viable clean table was produced and after this "sketch" was made, the steps in order to achieve the new data frame were listed and followed.
