## Project Description

For IronHack's DATA 08.20 cohort the following Tableau workbook was created, including the creation of different sheets, dashboards to organize them and a story.


## Questions & Process


For the understanding of how to achieve a healthy, sustainable urban lifestyle and in order to reach the United Nation's Sustainable Development goals, we need to understand the current situation in the elements that play major role in climate change: cities. It is from the following questions and frame of work that the visualizations were produced. 


"The Sustainable Development Goals are a call for action by all countries – poor, rich and middle-income – to promote prosperity while protecting the planet. They recognize that ending poverty must go hand-in-hand with strategies that build economic growth and address a range of social needs, including education, health, social protection, and job opportunities, while tackling climate change and environmental protection."

Cities, already by the year 2050 are expected to be home for most of the World's population. Therefore Cities, their structure, infrastructure, organization, services and people are one of the world's most important topics to address in order to achieve a sustainable future. 

Questions:

How are the top cities with most Urban Built Infrastructure populated? How are these built spaces relating to the open spaces of the cities? How are these spaces related to the quantity of people living in it? How is the relation between Rural and Urban built areas? 

## Workflow


Sheets:

1. World Map with Top 100 Cities with Urban Built Area
2. Bar Graph with Top 50 Cities with Urban Built Area
3. Bar Graph with Top 10 Cities with Urban Built Area
4. Area Graph with Top 10 Cities comparison of Urban Built versus Open Areas
5. Line Graph with Top 10 Cities comparison of Urban versus Rural Areas
6. Pie Chart with Top 10 Cities with Average Block Size
7. Bar graph of Top 50 Cities with Population

Dashboards:

1. Combination Top 50 Cities Built vs Population
2. Editing legend Urban Built versus Open Space of top 10
3. Editing legend Urban versus Rural Areas of top 10
4. Editing legend and placement Pie Chart
